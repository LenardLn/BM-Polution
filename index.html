        <h1>Mining the Depths</h1>
        <p>
          In the heart of Maramureș County, Baia Mare emerged as a mining
          powerhouse. Since Roman times, the region has been known for its rich
          deposits of gold, silver, and other precious metals. By the 20th
          century, industrial-scale mining began transforming the city. Massive
          tunnels were carved into the mountains, and heavy machinery processed
          ore day and night. While jobs and economic activity increased, so did
          the pressure on the environment. Workers toiled in harsh conditions,
          extracting resources that powered local industry but at an escalating
          ecological cost.

        <p>
          The mining boom came with a visible cost: air pollution. The Turnul
          Combinatului, a towering industrial chimney, became a symbol of Baia
          Mare’s prosperity and its pollution. Smelting facilities and chemical
          plants released toxic fumes into the air. Residents lived in the shadow
          of constant smoke, with respiratory issues and environmental degradation
          becoming increasingly common. The skyline of Baia Mare, once a beacon of
          progress, darkened with soot and industrial haze.

        <h1>The Cyanide Disaster</h1>
        <p>
          In January 2000, tragedy struck. A dam holding cyanide-contaminated
          water at the Aurul gold processing plant burst. Over 100,000 cubic
          meters of toxic waste spilled into the Someș River, contaminating the
          Tisza and Danube rivers across several countries. This environmental
          disaster devastated aquatic life, poisoned water supplies, and brought
          international scrutiny to Baia Mare. It was one of Europe's worst
          ecological catastrophes in decades.

        <h1>Rivers Tainted</h1>
        <p>
          The toxic waste didn’t just poison the rivers momentarily; it altered their ecosystems for years.
          Fish died by the thousands, birds feeding along the rivers suffered, and communities lost access
          to safe drinking water. The rivers that once nourished life became symbols of environmental neglect.
          The need for stricter regulations and rehabilitation is clearer than ever.
